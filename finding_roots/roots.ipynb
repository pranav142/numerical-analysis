The technique goes as follows:\n",

    "Newton's method unlike the first one can converge the quickest, however it requires the function to be differentiable. The method works calculating the tangent line at the inital guess x and then finding out where this tangent line intersects with the x axis. This value then becomes our new x value and we repeat this process. This process works because the derivative points us towards the local optimum and looking at the zero's of the tangent line will take us to the zero. The technique is described in detail below\n",
